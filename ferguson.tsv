Question for #Ferguson police chief? If OFFICER DARREN WILSON was in pursuit of a robbery suspect, why tell kids to get out of the road?LIE	1
That was very ""SLICK" of the Police Chief to create a narrative that #MikeBrown was a "suspect" in a robbery! #Ferguson	1
Let's be clear, #Ferguson PD never said Officer Darren Wilson was responding to robbery call before contact w/ #MikeBrown untiltoday.	1
Police name the officer who shot #Ferguson teenager #MichaelBrown. Watch: http://t.co/O76WptH1nE\nhttp://t.co/R6bxjsY9CZ	1
7) #MikeBrown was approached for mouthing off to a cop (both  #Ferguson PD &amp; eyewitness testimonies reflect this). NOT as a robberysuspect	1
Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions againsthim.	1
Because, of course, when someone commits a robbery they stroll down the middle of the street where everyone can see them.#Ferguson	1
REMINDER: #MikeBrown was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street. And for that, HE IS DEAD. Those are the facts.#Ferguson	1
today #MichaelBrown would've completed his 1st week of college &amp; #Ferguson police chief spent most time suggesting he's thecriminal	1
Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed" robbery in#Ferguson	1
Hold on while Chief Jackson sprinkles a little crack on that Mike Brown crime scene ...#Ferguson	1
#MikeBrown wanted to walk down the street. And he is dead. And the #Ferguson PD is using his silence in death to make him acriminal.	1
BREAKING NEWS: According to documents released to the press, #MikeBrown was connected to an earlier robbery #Fergusonhttp://t.co/LuCR9711S0	1
I personally don't trust St. Louis County PD, and I think they waited all this time to forge and falsify evidence. #Ferguson#MikeBrown	1
Oh, a suspect in a robbery? That changes everything. Everyone knows summary execution is the penalty for suspicion of robbery#Ferguson	1
Every time the police talk, their story changes. I hate it.#Ferguson	1

So the angel Michael Brown who is 6'4"" 290 is the robber of the convenience store! #Fergusonhttp://t.co/d81cQPHzbi	1
The surveillance tape the police have on TV DOESNT even look like anything near Canfield Green apts. #MIKEBROWN#Ferguson	1
The info given today seems to line up with this witness account, even the alleged theft: http://t.co/7hjBIrf1a3\n\n#Ferguson#MikeBrown	1
If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself?#Ferguson	1
#Ferguson police hand out info to make Michael Brown seem like a thug. But nothing on how he was actually killed, interaction withofficer.	1
I'm NOT believing this story because I know how the police lie and will keep lying and will organize together AND LIE. #MIKEBROWN#Ferguson	1
It's not #MikeBrown in those #Ferguson police video stills. Not unless he changed his shoes after the robbery but before he met theofficer.	1
If Dorian Johnson is a suspect in a robbery that justified #DarrenWilson killing #MikeBrown, why hasn't Dorian been arrested?#Ferguson	1
Police in #Ferguson, once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of them allegedly beathim."	1
Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/rl0RgIphUphttp://t.co/PHUofG7mJR	1
Bottom line: cops are supposed to use deadly force only when lives are at risk. You don't shoot robbery suspects.#Ferguson	1
So police narrative in #Ferguson is unarmed teen suspected in unarmed robbery was shot to death. We've still got a problem,Chief.	1
#Ferguson Police apparently has a history of fabrication. http://t.co/x1d3QTfEBx	1
MORE: #Ferguson police chief identifies Darren Wilson as cop who shot Michael Brown http://t.co/Qojlgp8mlchttp://t.co/mwZBmZjAst	1
Being shot 10 times in the street for stealing cigars is due process? No arrest. No trial. No conviction―just immediate execution.#Ferguson	1
the police version is also that #MikeBrown approached the officer. But if he had JUST robbed a store, why approach police??#Ferguson	1
An observation from yrs in practice - if it takes you 5 days to get your story out &amp; it doesn't make sense, it's probably not true#Ferguson	1
.....for a cover-up to be successful....you must first discredit thevictim.....\n\n#Ferguson	1
And I feel silly for pointing this out but...\n\nIn America we don't have  executions by gunfire for alleged robberies. #Ferguson#MikeBrown	1
So lets recap. No dashboard cam of the incident. But definitely photos of Michael Brown in a store. Funny how that happens #NMOS14#Ferguson	1
Cops were extra aggressive to incite fear and cause chaos, giving the #Ferguson PD time to destroy and/or manufacture any ""evidence"needed	1
The police chief is a 5 star general in projection, imagination and deflection...took a week to hatch this theory#Ferguson	1
Just did a google map search. There are 2 Quick Trips in #Ferguson and they are on opposite ends of the town. Did #MikeBrownteleport?	1
basically #Ferguson PD did an opposition research dump on mike brown, and not theirjobs	1
Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing when he was laying on the street to the security footage?#Ferguson	1
In 2009 #Ferguson PD beat a black man, then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms http://t.co/Y1QTm1BZythttp://t.co/KcuZ5VFMOn	1
so #MikeBrown's hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right? #Fergusonhttp://t.co/2zu5sUH84S	1
so if he was with #DorianJohnson at the robbery why wasn't he in custody? All media outlets interviewed him before the police#Ferguson	1
The selective release of information by #Ferguson PD tells us nothing about the shooting. Instead appears to be a basic smearjob.	1
Here's the police report. Somehow #Ferguson cops valued a box of Swishers at nearly $50. Time to stop smokin I guesshttp://t.co/8ZkvrHkApc	1
#Ferguson cops beat innocent man then charged him for bleeding on them: http://t.co/u1ot9Eh5Cq via @MichaelDalynychttp://t.co/AGJW2Pid1r	1
This is simple: IF #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect, why didn’t #Ferguson police say that on DAY ONE? Why wait sixdays?	1
#Ferguson PD releases robbery incident report smearing #MikeBrown but not shooting incident report. Did they think we wouldn’tnotice?	1
These surveillance images were taken at a convenience store 10 min. Before #MichaelBrown was shot Sat. #Fergusonhttp://t.co/mnReDcRfzz	1
DARREN WILSON\nMURDERED AN UNARMED TEEN\nLEFT HIS BODY IN THE STREET FOR 4 HRS\n\nAnything else isirrelevant.\n#MikeBrown\n#Ferguson\n#CoverUp	1
Let's not forget that even if Mike Brown did shoplift, that's not why police said he was stopped or why he was shot. #mikebrown#ferguson	1
So basically #Ferguson PD hijacked what was supposed to be a press conference about Darren Wilson to call Michael Brown a criminal#NMOS14	1
If Mike Brown was engaged in a robbery before being shot, why isn't his alleged accomplice under arrest? #Fergusonhttp://t.co/upMLU4bbK4	1
The surveillance photos, the police report, and this witness account. #Ferguson http://t.co/Sbx9tfA5FAhttp://t.co/JGgtaXYOxz	1
So in 5mins mike brown shaved his head and changed his scandals to shoes. I think your being lied too #Fergusonhttp://t.co/GSaYdYUhJr	1
Assuming #MichaelBrown and #DorianJohnson were involved in robbery, when can we expect President Obama's apology to the #FergusonPD?\n#tcot	1
Looks like #Ferguson PD spent their whole week on a smear campaign against #MikeBrown instead of investigating or being at allhelpful.	1
So a large Negro robbed a store and then the cops saw a large Negro.\n\nWHAT WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!\n\nPerhaps not execute him.#Ferguson	1
I'm not retweeting the pic of #MikeBrown's body, but evidently he lost the hat and changed his shoes and shorts. And lost ~40 lbs.#Ferguson	1

Wow! What was the point of bring out the robbery footage today if it had nothing to do with Michael Brown being stopped?#Ferguson	1
so ... they clearly released that video  only to shame &amp; blame the victim. #Ferguson#MikeBrown	1
So since we now know the officer knew nothing abt a robbery, we must ask why those tapes were released? #Ferguson. But we knowwhy.	1
Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind.#Ferguson	1
shorter #ferguson pd: ""damn, we thought we could dirty up this guys name, we didn't think you guys wouldCHECK"	1
Ferguson PD now admits that Darren Wilson didn't know anything about the store robbery when he stopped Mike Brown! This is bad!#Ferguson	1
Cop who shot Brown did not know he was a robbery suspect, #Ferguson police chief says http://t.co/9pWsMI9HOjhttp://t.co/urxcAQk7Uy	1
The #Ferguson police chief just basically confirmed #MikeBrown was gunned to death for the crime of walking in thestreet?\n\nHorrific.	1
What's so frustrating is that now we are talking about a robbery and not the killing of an unarmed kid.#ferguson	1
They released that information this morning about the robbery KNOWING #MikeBrown wasn't stopped for it? Explain why. EXPLAIN. WHY.#Ferguson	1
So, to sum up: 1) Darren Wilson KNEW NOTHING of the robbery, 2) shot #MikeBrown over jaywalking, and 3) was allowed to escape#Ferguson.	1
#Ferguson chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery &amp; stopped #MikeBrown for jay walking. #TheJighttp://t.co/uLWzIJH5WJ	1
Are we supposed to be cool &amp; remain calm when the police after MURDERING a teenager SLANDER him to hide the killing behind racism?#Ferguson	1
#Ferguson police chief says officer Darren Wilson didn't know #MikeBrown was a robbery suspecthttp://t.co/SbpxzwwZWs	1

#Ferguson Police Chief says #MikeBrown was stopped because he was walking in road NOT because he was suspected of stealingcigars.	1
Oh, whoops, the robbery had nothing to do with #MikeBrown being stopped, but at least now half of America thinks it did. - #FergusonPD	1
.@CNN KEEPS playing the video while saying it has nothing to do with the murder of #MikeBrown this is PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFAE.#FERGUSON	1

This is what #Ferguson PD did to #HenryDavis in 2009 when they mistook him for a man with an outstanding warranthttp://t.co/ZdHpyHfrCh	1
Since FBI is investigating the shooting, isn't Darren Wilson a fugitive &amp; the cops who let him leave accessories after the fact?#Ferguson	1
to be clear: an unarmed teenager POSSIBLY stealing a box of cigars does not warrant being shot to death by the police.#Ferguson	1
People got even angrier after the admission that the #Ferguson store theft had nothing to do with why Brown was stopped byWilson.	1
#Ferguson PD charged #HenryDavis w/ ""destruction of property" for bleeding on their uniforms: http://t.co/qQWPClW3tGhttp://t.co/5U3nMoMiF2	1
Oh. So NOW the #Ferguson police chief says the cop didn't know about the robbery when he stopped #MikeBrown. The kid was ""jaywalking"?BS!	1
